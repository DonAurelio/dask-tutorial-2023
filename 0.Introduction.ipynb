    "# Parallelize your Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask is a **library for parallel/distributed computing** in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Python users can achieve **data parallelism**, by using Dask libraries such as `Dask Array` (mimic Numpy), `Dask DataFrame` (mimic Pandas), or `Dask Bag`.\n",
    "* Users can also achieve **task parallelism** by using libraries such as `Dask Delayed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask is open source and freely available. It is developed in coordination with other community projects like Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "__What Does This Mean?__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Built in Python\n",
    "* Scales *properly* from single laptops to 1000-node clusters\n",
    "* Leverages and interops with existing Python APIs as much as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "__About Dask__\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask was created in 2014 as part of the Blase project, a DARPA funded project at Continuum/Anaconda. It has since grown into a multi-institution community project with developers from projects including NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter and Scikit-Learn. Many of the core Dask maintainers are employed to work on the project by companies including Continuum/Anaconda, Prefect, NVIDIA, Capital One, Saturn Cloud and Coiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, Dask allows a variety of parallel workflows using existing Python constructs, patterns, or libraries, including dataframes, arrays (scaling out Numpy), bags (an unordered collection construct a bit like `Counter`), and `concurrent.futures`\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to working in conjunction with Python ecosystem tools, Dask's extremely low scheduling overhead (nanoseconds in some cases) allows it work well even on single machines, and smoothly scale up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask supports a variety of use cases for industry and research: https://stories.dask.org/en/latest/\n",
    "\n",
    "With its recent 2.x releases, and integration to other projects (e.g., RAPIDS for GPU computation), many commercial enterprises are paying attention and jumping in to parallel Python with Dask.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Dask Ecosystem__\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the core Dask library and its Distributed scheduler, the Dask ecosystem connects several additional initiatives, including...\n",
    "* Dask ML - parallel machine learning, with a scikit-learn-style API\n",
    "* Dask-kubernetes\n",
    "* Dask-XGBoost\n",
    "* Dask-YARN\n",
    "* Dask-image\n",
    "* Dask-cuDF\n",
    "* ... and some others\n",
    "\n",
    "__What's Not Part of Dask?__\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of functions that integrate to Dask, but are not represented in the core Dask ecosystem, including...\n",
    "\n",
    "* a SQL engine\n",
    "* data storage\n",
    "* data catalog\n",
    "* visualization\n",
    "* coarse-grained scheduling / orchestration\n",
    "* streaming"
